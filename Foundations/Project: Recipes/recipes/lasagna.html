    <h1>Homemade Lasagna</h1>

    <h2>Description</h2>
    This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty,
    made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more
    traditional homemade lasagna
    filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd
    cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green
    salad and crusty garlic bread.
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Meat</li>
            <li>Spices</li>
            <li>Pasta</li>
        </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
            <li>
                <strong>Cook the meat:</strong> Cook the ground meat in a skillet until browned and crumbly.
                Add the onion and continue cooking until it's translucent. Stir in the canned
                tomato products, half of the parsley, garlic, basil, 1.5 teaspoons of salt,
                oregano, and sugar.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Cook the noodles:</strong> Boil the lasagna noodles in lightly salted water until 
                they're al dente.</li>
            <li>
                <strong>Make the cheese layer:</strong> Mix cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, eggs, the remaining parsley,
                the remaining salt, and pepper in a bowl.</li>
        </ol>
